# Esetech - Coding Test

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

This describes a short coding test youâ€™ll need to complete in order for us to assess your technical skills for the Full-stack Developer position at Esetech. You have been provided with the bare-bone files/folders to start with. The repo contains a nodejs/firebase installed server folder and ReactJS installed client folder. Clone this repository to start.

## Project Overview:

You are to produce a React JS SPA that accurately represents the provided details below. Create a simple user management application. The application should allow users to add, edit, delete, and list users information. Manipulate the response, and display the result to the user whilst enabling them to filter the list. Use React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Firebase for data storage.

## Task Breakdown:

### Deadline:

You are required to use a maximum of 3 hours for the attempt/completion of this task. Any submission made after the deadline WILL NOT be considered. We have a suggested time allocation below, however, you can allot your time as you wish.

- 15 mins to read through these instructions and set up your project.
- 2 hours and 30 minutes to code the task.
- 15 mins to deploy code to GitHub Repo and submit the task.

### Frontend (React.js):

- Create a user interface for managing users.
- Display a list of users with their basic information (name, username, email, address, etc.).
- Implement functionality to add a new user.
- Implement functionality to edit existing user details.
- Implement functionality to delete a user.
- Use React for routing if necessary.
- Apply Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Backend (Node.js):

- Set up a simple server using Node.js to handle API requests.
- Create APIs for CRUD operations on user data (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Connect the backend to Firebase.
- Use Firebase Firestore to store user data.
- Implement basic server-side validation for user data (e.g., email format validation).
- Ensure proper error handling and validation in API requests.

### Integration (Firebase):

- Set up a Firebase project to store user data.
- Configure Firebase authentication (optional, if you want to add user-specific features).
- Ensure that the frontend and backend communicate effectively with Firebase.

### Styling:

- You may use any existing styling libraries (e.g. TailwindCSS, Material UI, Ant Design, etc) OR utilize vanilla CSS. The choice is yours!
- Responsiveness: UI elements should scale appropriately in larger viewports. However, any attempt to make the UI elements responsive in medium and smaller viewports is not a hard requirement. It should only be considered if you have extra time to work on this feature.

## Submission

Upon submission of the task, you are required to do the following;

- If you feel you don't need the full time to complete the task, please do submit it earlier. On the other hand, if you are running short of time simply submit what you have before the deadline.
- To submit your work, kindly fill out this form and provide answers to the questions as correctly as you can.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Code structure and organization.
- Proper use of React.js and its features.
- Effective state management.
- Backend API design and implementation.
- Data storage and retrieval using Firebase.
- Responsive and well-styled UI.
- Error handling and validation.
- Bonus points for additional features like user authentication.
